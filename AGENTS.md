# Reffy Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.references/` when the request:
- Mentions early-stage ideation, exploration, brainstorming, or raw notes
- Needs context before drafting specs or proposals
- Refers to "reffy", "references", "explore", "I'm thinking about", "context layer"

Use `.references/` to:
- Store and read exploratory artifacts (canonical source of truth)
- Sync to Linear via the local Reffy server if configured
